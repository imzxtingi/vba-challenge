A lot of the code written in here was modeled after the VBA class activity on credit card checkers and also the class activity gradebook conditionals to find the code for text formatting
The LastRow code was found on StackOverflow so that I could find the last row of the excel sheet
The Maximum and Minimum code was also found on StackOverflow to calculate the maximum of greatest % increase, the minimum to calculate the greatest % decrease, and the greatest total stock volume
The percent formatting code was also found on StackOverflow to change the column to reflect in % instead of decimals
